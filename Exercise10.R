#Question 1
#To test nested models, treat them like a null vs alternate hypothesis
#Comparing with null is detailed in lecture notes
#Be sure to get data.txt

#Question 2
#I think it wants output from a three scenarios of alpha values
#Most efficient if one is the first logical statement is false
  #Then second is false
  #Then both are true, which should lead to coexistence
#Model should predict the population of both species at various time steps
